# C++ Neural Network Implementation

The code uses Eigen "which is already within the source code" & SFML.

The code assumes that SFML is installed and located somewhere, to run the code you need to change where your native SFML library is located on the "Task.json" file.

To run the code follow the following instructions 
1. Download MingW32 or Clang if you haven't already
2. Install the compiler and make it so that it is in the Environment path file
3. Install Vscode C++ Extension
4. On the Task.json file, modify where the Include and the Lib directories are located.
